##Step 1: Inspect the Node.py file
Inspect the class declaration for a doubly-linked list node in Node.py. Access Node.py by clicking on the orange arrow next to main.py at the top of the coding window. The Node class has three attributes:

a floating-point data value,
a reference to the next node, and
a reference to the previous node.
Node.py is read-only, since no changes are required.

Step 2: Implement the insert() method
A class for a sorted, doubly-linked list is declared in SortedNumberList.py. Implement the SortedNumberList class's insert() method. The method must create a new node with the parameter value, then insert the node into the proper sorted position in the linked list. Ex: Suppose a SortedNumberList's current list is 23 → 47.25 → 86, then insert(33.5) is called. A new node with data value 33.5 is created and inserted between 23 and 47.25, thus preserving the list's sorted order and yielding: 23 → 35.5 → 47.25 → 86

Step 3: Test in development mode
Code in main() takes a space-separated list of numbers and inserts each into a SortedNumberList. The list is displayed after each insertion. Ex: If input is 77 15 -42 63.5。

then output is:

‘’‘
List after inserting 77: 
77 
List after inserting 15: 
15 77 
List after inserting -42: 
-42 15 77 
List after inserting 63.5: 
-42 15 63.5 77
’‘’
